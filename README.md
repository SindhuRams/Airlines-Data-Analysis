# Airlines-Data-Analysis

INTRODUCTION

There are tons of data that is generated today, and big data is spread across most of the domains. It comes as no surprise that big data can be used for analysis of flight delays. There are several factors that are related and affecting delay as well as the cancellation of flights. Identifying causes that are related to such issues is hence necessary. Ways to improve customer service will not only improve the reputation of the flights but as well as reliance of customers on the airlines. The purpose of choosing this data is that when any person travels by a flight and if it is delayed or cancelled it disturbs the schedule ahead, and we end up rating the flight with bad reviews. To overcome these circumstances, there is a need to address business problems associated with flights , airports as well as reasons behind as to what is causing this problem.

PROJECT GOAL

Airlines being one of the highest revenues generating industries across the globe still have many challenges when it comes to providing the best customer experience, and the major ones being delays & cancellations. Our goal is to come up with the analysis that helps airline industries to find they are lagging and improve the customer experience.

BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES OF THE DATA

1.	What are the reasons For Flight Cancellations based on highest cancelled Destination??
2.	What is the maximum Delay Attribute by considering Airlines, Destination Airport and the Flight Number for analysis??
3.	 When is the best day of week/time of year to fly to minimize delays??
4.	What days in the week and month accumulated most delayed flights?

INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

From the above experimental results, we can see that interesting sets of trends and patterns Existing in our airline’s dataset. The dataset is huge and complex but with help of big data technologies like spark, hive helped us to harness the power of parallel processing of a Cluster and faster processing and better visualization of results. From our queries and results we see the  following observations:

	There is a sharp rise in the number of flights which are cancelled in the months of February, January, March and May and Highest numbers of flights which are cancelled have a less flight distances like less 1000 miles or so.
	Average flight departure delay is at peak during November in Guam International Airport
	The highest mean arrival delay is registered in March in Wilmington Airport.
	Indeed, the later in the day, the more delays there are, because flight delays are usually cumulative. Because flights that arrive late in the night still arrive after midnight, the early hours of the day are the ones that accumulate the most delay time.
	For different types of delays the analysis of peak volumes is as follows- Air system delay- 58562 flights in June, Security Delay- Highest at 534 Flights in December, Airline Delay-Maximum value is  63635 in June,  Weather Delay – Peak at 8940 flights in February
	No surprise that most delays are concentrated more towards weekends, and the average total delay annually seems to peak in the months of June and February.
